# Practice Command Based Robot Code (Prog Workshop)
Practice command based robot code for Jo, used for 2021 robot code workshop (yes, we're making the switch to command based finallyyyyyyyyyyy)

Todo: create example of default commands for drivetrain (default drive), update example for next year (consider using differential drive, which gives us more time to try creating an intake, for instance, no pun intended)
